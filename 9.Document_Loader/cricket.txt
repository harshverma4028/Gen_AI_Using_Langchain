Beneath the sun, on fields of green,  
A game unfolds, a timeless scene.  
The crack of bat, the ball's swift flight,  
A dance of skill beneath the light.

The bowler runs with focused grace,  
A challenge in his steady pace.  
The ball takes off, a blur of speed,  
A batter's eyes, sharp as a reed.

The crowd holds breath, the tension high,  
Will the ball fall, or will it fly?  
A swing, a miss, the stumps may fall,  
Or a powerful strike that breaks the wall.

The fielders race, their gloves held tight,  
In perfect sync, they chase the light.  
A catch in the air, a leap so grand,  
The ball falls soft into their hand.

From dusk till dawn, the game will play,  
Through sunshine bright or skies of gray.  
Cricket’s not just bat and ball,  
But a heart that beats for the sport, for all.

It’s friendship forged with every match,  
A timeless bond none can detach.  
For in the game, we find our grace,  
In cricket's spirit, every face.
